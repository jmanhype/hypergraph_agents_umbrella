# A2A Agent Umbrella

This directory is the Elixir Mix umbrella for the Hypergraph Agents project. It manages all core Elixir apps and dependencies for the distributed agentic AI system.

## Structure

- **apps/a2a_agent/** — Core agent protocol logic, registry, and validation
- **apps/a2a_agent_web/** — Phoenix API app for HTTP endpoints, orchestration, and event streaming
- **apps/engine/** — Workflow execution engine (XCS), supporting DAGs and parallel execution
- **apps/hypergraph_agent/** — Orchestrator and workflow manager for agentic tasks
- **apps/operator/** — Operator library (LLM, Map, Sequence, Parallel, etc.)

## What is a Mix Umbrella?
A Mix umbrella project allows you to manage multiple interdependent Elixir apps in a single repository. Each app can be developed, tested, and released independently, but dependencies and configuration are managed centrally.

## Responsibilities
- Centralizes configuration and dependency management
- Coordinates development, testing, and release of all core Elixir apps
- Enables modular, scalable architecture for agentic AI workflows

## Development Workflow
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   mix deps.get
   ```
2. **Run all tests:**
   ```sh
   mix test
   ```
3. **Start the Phoenix API:**
   ```sh
   cd apps/a2a_agent_web
   mix phx.server
   ```
4. **Develop and test individual apps:**
   ```sh
   cd apps/engine
   mix test
   ```

## Adding a New App
1. Generate a new app:
   ```sh
   mix new apps/my_new_app
   ```
2. Add it as a dependency in other apps' `mix.exs` if needed.
3. Document its purpose and usage in its own `README.md`.

## Dependency Management
- Shared deps are managed in the umbrella's `mix.exs`.
- Each app can declare its own deps in its `mix.exs`.
- Use `mix deps.get` at the umbrella root to sync all dependencies.
