# Hypergraph Agents Umbrella: A Multi-Language, High-Performance Agentic AI Framework

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent Communication)

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol serves as the universal language that enables agents in the Hypergraph ecosystem to communicate regardless of their implementation language or location. This protocol establishes a standardized way for agents to discover each other, request tasks, stream results, and coordinate complex workflows.

#### Protocol Format and Specifications

All A2A messages follow a consistent JSON format with required fields:

```json
{
  "type": "task_request",
  "sender": "agent1",
  "recipient": "agent2",
  "payload": {
    "task_id": "t1",
    "stream": true,
    "graph": {
      "nodes": [],
      "edges": []
    }
  }
}
```

Key components of the protocol include:

- **type**: Defines the message purpose (e.g., task_request, task_progress, result)
- **sender**: Identifier of the originating agent
- **recipient**: Target agent identifier
- **payload**: Message-specific data structure

The protocol is accessed through HTTP endpoints:
- Elixir: `POST /api/a2a`
- Python: `/api/a2a` (via FastAPI)

#### Message Types

The A2A protocol supports several message types to facilitate different kinds of interactions:

1. **task_request**: Initiates a task execution request from one agent to another
2. **task_progress**: Provides updates on ongoing task execution
3. **task_chunk**: Delivers partial results for streaming operations
4. **result**: Returns completed task results
5. **agent_event**: Communicates agent lifecycle events
6. **agent_discovery**: Used to discover and register available agents

Each message type has specific payload expectations and handling procedures.

#### Cross-Language Communication

A key strength of the A2A protocol is its language-agnostic design. The minimal Python agent demonstrates this capability:

```python
@app.post("/api/a2a")
async def a2a_endpoint(request: Request):
    """Accept A2A messages and stream responses if requested."""
    body = await request.json()
    msg_type = body["type"]
    payload = body.get("payload", {})

    if msg_type == "task_request" and payload.get("stream", False):
        return StreamingResponse(stream_task_progress())
    # ... handling for other message types
```

This Python implementation can seamlessly communicate with Elixir agents, demonstrating how the protocol bridges language barriers.

#### Error Handling

The protocol includes built-in error handling mechanisms:

1. **Validation**: Messages are validated for required fields and proper structure before processing
2. **Error Responses**: Standardized error message format with status codes and descriptive messages
3. **Timeouts**: Mechanisms for handling unresponsive agents
4. **Retry Logic**: Patterns for retrying failed communications

For example, error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "type": "validation_error",
  "error": "Missing required field: type"
}
```

The A2A protocol's comprehensive design enables sophisticated multi-agent interactions while maintaining simplicity for implementations across languages, making it the foundation upon which the entire Hypergraph Agents ecosystem operates.
