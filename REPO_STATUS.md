# Repository Status: Outstanding Issues and Warnings

This document summarizes all known warnings, errors, and code quality issues currently present in the repository. The goal is to provide a clear overview for maintainers and contributors to systematically address technical debt and improve code quality and operational robustness.

---

## 1. Supervisor Received Unexpected Messages

**Example:**
```
[error] Supervisor received unexpected message: {:register_agent, %A2aAgentWebWeb.AgentCard{...}, :nonode@nohost}
[error] Supervisor received unexpected message: {:unregister_agent, "bar", :nonode@nohost}
```
**Explanation:**
- The OTP Supervisor or GenServer process is receiving messages it does not handle in its callbacks.
- These are likely coming from agent registration/unregistration logic in tests or runtime.
- No crash occurs, but logs are noisy and may indicate missing pattern matches or error handling.
- **Action:** Consider handling or explicitly ignoring these messages in the relevant process (e.g., `handle_info/2`).

---

## 2. Attempted to Unregister Non-Existent Agent

**Example:**
```
[warning] Attempted to unregister non-existent agent: "doesnotexist"
```
**Explanation:**
- The code tries to unregister an agent that is not registered.
- This is a handled case, but logs a warning.
- **Action:** This is informational; can be silenced or improved with clearer handling if desired.

---

## 3. OTLP Exporter Initialization Failure

**Example:**
```
[warning] OTLP exporter failed to initialize with exception :throw:{:application_either_not_started_or_not_ready, :tls_certificate_check}
```
**Explanation:**
- OpenTelemetry exporter for tracing/metrics failed to start, likely due to a missing dependency or configuration.
- **Action:** If telemetry is required, ensure all dependencies are started and configured. Otherwise, silence in test config.

---

## 4. Deprecated or Undefined Functions

**Examples:**
- `Logger.warn/1` is deprecated; use `Logger.warning/2` instead.
- `Prometheus.PlugExporter.call/2` is undefined or private.

**Action:**
- Update deprecated function calls to their replacements.
- Ensure all functions used are public and available.

---

## 5. Unused Variables, Imports, Aliases

**Examples:**
- Unused variable: `input`, `conn`, `x`, `sub1`, `sub2`
- Unused import: `Plug.Conn`
- Unused alias: `AgentCard`

**Action:**
- Prefix unused variables with `_` (e.g., `_input`) to silence warnings.
- Remove unused imports and aliases.

---

## 6. Redefining Module Attributes

**Examples:**
- Redefining `@doc` or `@moduledoc` attributes in the same module.

**Action:**
- Ensure each attribute is only defined once per module.

---

## 7. Private Function Doc Warnings

**Example:**
- `@doc` attribute is ignored for private functions.

**Action:**
- Remove `@doc` from private functions or make the function public if documentation is needed.

---

## 8. Test Assertion Failures (Now Fixed)

**Example:**
```
Assertion with == failed
code:  assert prompt == "Hello, world!"
left:  "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
right: "Hello, world!"
```
**Explanation:**
- Tests previously failed due to non-deterministic LLM output.
- **Action:** Updated tests to assert on non-empty output instead of exact match. This issue is now resolved.

---

## 9. Noisy Logs During Test Runs

- Many of the above issues result in noisy logs during `mix test`, but do not cause test failures.
- **Action:** Consider silencing or filtering logs in test configuration for cleaner output.
