# HyperTree Planner Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying and running the HyperTree Planner application, which is a component of the larger Hypergraph Agents Umbrella framework.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the HyperTree Planner, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1.  **Erlang/OTP and Elixir:** The correct versions of Erlang and Elixir must be installed on the deployment server. The project is developed with Elixir 1.17 and Erlang/OTP 26. It's recommended to use a version manager like `asdf` to manage these dependencies.
2.  **Hex and Rebar3:** The Elixir build tool `mix` requires Hex (Elixir's package manager) and Rebar3 (Erlang's build tool) to be installed. These can typically be installed with `mix local.hex` and `mix local.rebar`.
3.  **Operating System:** The application is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04). While it may run on other operating systems, compatibility is not guaranteed.
4.  **External Services:**
    *   **LLM Access:** The HyperTree Planner relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) for certain functionalities. Ensure that the environment where the application is deployed has access to the configured LLM service and that any necessary API keys or credentials are provided (e.g., via environment variables).
    *   **NATS Server (Optional but Recommended):** If the HyperTree Planner is intended to communicate with other agents or services within the Hypergraph Agents Umbrella framework using asynchronous messaging, a NATS server must be running and accessible.

## Deployment Steps

1.  **Obtain the Source Code:**
    *   Clone the `hypergraph_agents_umbrella` repository from its source (e.g., GitHub):
        ```bash
        git clone <repository_url>
        cd hypergraph_agents_umbrella
        ```
    *   Ensure the `hyper_tree_planner` application is present in the `apps/` directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Navigate to the root directory of the umbrella project.
    *   Fetch and install all dependencies for the umbrella project, including those for the `hyper_tree_planner` application:
        ```bash
        mix deps.get
        ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    *   The HyperTree Planner might require specific configurations, such as API keys for LLM services or connection details for NATS. These are typically managed through Elixir's configuration system (e.g., `config/config.exs`, `config/runtime.exs`, or environment variables).
    *   Consult the application's documentation or source code for specific configuration parameters that need to be set. For example, ensure the `config :tesla, MyLLM, api_key: "your_api_key"` or similar is correctly set if you are using a specific LLM client library that requires it.

4.  **Compile the Project:**
    *   Compile the entire umbrella project, which will also compile the `hyper_tree_planner` application:
        ```bash
        mix compile
        ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   The HyperTree Planner, as part of an umbrella project, typically runs within the context of the main application. If the umbrella project is a Phoenix application, for instance, you would start it using: `mix phx.server`
    *   If it's a standalone OTP application, you might run it using `iex -S mix` for interactive mode or build a release for production deployment.

## Production Deployment (General Guidelines)

For a production environment, consider the following: 

1.  **Releases:** Use Elixir releases for deploying the application. Releases provide a self-contained package with Erlang/OTP and all your project's code, making deployment simpler and more robust. You can create a release using `mix release`.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials using environment variables, rather than hardcoding them into configuration files.
3.  **Logging:** Configure appropriate logging levels and destinations for production monitoring and troubleshooting.
4.  **Process Management:** Use a process manager like `systemd` or `supervisor` to ensure the application runs continuously and is restarted if it crashes.
5.  **Security:** Ensure your deployment environment is secure, including network configurations, firewalls, and regular security updates.

## Notes

*   This guide assumes a basic understanding of Elixir, Mix, and the OTP framework.
*   Refer to the official Elixir documentation and the documentation for any specific libraries or tools used in the project for more detailed information.

This document provides a general guideline for deploying the HyperTree Planner. Specific deployment steps might vary based on the overall architecture of the Hypergraph Agents Umbrella and the target deployment environment.
