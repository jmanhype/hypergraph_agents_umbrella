defmodule HyperTreePlanner.Operators.HyperchainExtractorOperator do
  @moduledoc """
  Operator responsible for extracting a set of hyperchains {C1,...,Cm} from the current Hypertree (H).

  This operator implements the `Map(H)` function as described in Algorithm 1 of the
  Top-down HyperTree Construction process. The core task is to traverse the hypertree
  and identify meaningful paths or sequences that represent potential plans or lines of reasoning.

  The actual logic for `Map(H)`—how hyperchains are defined and identified—is crucial
  and depends heavily on the structure of the `Hypertree` and the specific semantics
  of what constitutes a valid or interesting hyperchain for the planning problem.

  This initial implementation provides a basic placeholder for hyperchain extraction.
  A functional version would need a more sophisticated traversal and chain construction
  algorithm (e.g., depth-first search, pathfinding algorithms adapted for hypergraphs).

  alias HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hyperchain

  @doc """
  Extracts a list of `HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hyperchain` structs from the given
  `HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hypertree`.

  The input `params` map is expected to contain a `"hypertree"` key, where the value
  is a `HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hypertree` struct.

  The current placeholder logic creates a few dummy hyperchains, typically originating
  from a designated root node if one is identifiable in the hypertree (e.g., via a
  `root_node_id` field in the hypertree struct, which is not standard in the current
  `Hypertree` definition but used here as an example). A real implementation would
  involve graph traversal algorithms to find paths or subgraphs that qualify as hyperchains.

  Returns `{:ok, %{"hyperchains" => list_of_hyperchain_structs}}` on success, or
  `{:error, reason_string}` if the input hypertree is missing or invalid.

  ## Parameters

    - `params`: A map containing the input parameters. Expected to have a `"hypertree"` key
      with a `HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hypertree` struct as its value.

  ## Examples

      iex> h_tree = HyperTreePlanner.DataStructures.Hypertree.add_node(h_tree, "root", %{content: "root_query"})
      iex> # In a real scenario, h_tree might have a root_node_id or be more complex.
      iex> # For this example, we manually add a root_node_id to the metadata for the dummy logic.
      iex> h_tree_with_root = %{h_tree | metadata: %{root_node_id: "root"}}
      iex> params = %{"hypertree" => h_tree_with_root}
      iex> {:ok, result} = HyperTreePlanner.Operators.HyperchainExtractorOperator.call(params)
      iex> hyperchains = result["hyperchains"]
